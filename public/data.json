            "long_description": "Niagara Falls is one of the most famous and powerful natural wonders on the planet, straddling the border between the United States and Canada. Comprised of three separate waterfalls — Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls — it thunders with over 3,000 tons of water cascading every second. Visitors can experience its majesty up close aboard the Maid of the Mist boat tour or view the spectacle from observation decks surrounded by mist and rainbows. The surrounding region also offers scenic trails, light shows, and the charming town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, blending natural power with romantic beauty and family-friendly attractions.",

            "long_description": "Carhenge, located near Alliance, Nebraska, is a whimsical and creative tribute to England’s Stonehenge — but with a distinctly American twist. Built in 1987 by artist Jim Reinders, the monument is composed of 38 vintage automobiles arranged in the same proportions and layout as the original prehistoric structure. Each car is painted gray to mimic the color of weathered stone, giving the illusion of a metallic megalithic site. Carhenge celebrates both the ingenuity of modern art and America’s deep car culture, standing as a symbol of humor, imagination, and rural creativity that attracts thousands of curious visitors every year.",

Built in the 15th century under the Inca emperor Pachacuti, this 'Lost City' remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911. The site’s intricate stonework, terraces, and temples display the Incas’ mastery of engineering and architecture, all without the use of mortar. Surrounded by misty peaks and lush greenery, Machu Picchu offers not only a glimpse into the ancient world but also breathtaking panoramic views of the Urubamba Valley below. Today it stands as a symbol of human creativity harmoniously integrated with nature.",
